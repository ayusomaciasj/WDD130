            <p class="space-text">The goal of creating "Space Asteroids" was to imitate a game from the past. As implied by the title, the goal of the game is to shoot as many asteroids as you can in order to get a high score. Python was used to create this game, and object-oriented programming concepts were applied throughout. As we can see, the spaceship is portrayed as an entity with its own characteristics (such life and speed) and actions (like shooting and traveling). This game's object-oriented programming makes it possible to write code that is modular, reusable, and simple to maintain.</p>

            <p class="shop-text">HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript were used in the development of the shopping cart app. Its goal was to make purchasing more convenient. The cart's content, layout, and structural framework are all made with HTML. In order to ensure that the cart complements the website's appearance and improves user experience through aesthetically pleasing design components, CSS steps in to style and beautify it. The cart gains functionality from JavaScript, allowing for dynamic operations like item addition and removal. The purpose of this internet app is to facilitate our phone shopping list.</p>
