            <p class="space-text">The "Space Asteroids"game was made to try to simulate a yesteryear game. The purpose of the game as the name says is shooting asteroids as much as possible to achieve a highscore. This game was developed in Python using and applying object oriented programming principles as we can see the spaceship is represented as an object with its own attributes (such as speed, and life) and methods (such as shooting, and moving). The Object-oriented programming used in this game enables the creation of modular, reusable, and easily maintainable code.</p>

            <p class="shop-text">The shopping cart app was built using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Its purpose was to facilitate shopping experiences. The HTML forms the structural backbone, the layout and content of the cart. CSS steps in to style and beautify the cart, ensuring it aligns with the website's aesthetics and enhances user experience through visually appealing design elements. JavaScript injects functionality into the cart, enabling dynamic actions such as adding or removing items. This website appp was made to help the list that we do for shopping available in our phone.</p>
