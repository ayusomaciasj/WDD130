        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I am looking with this website to let people know a little more about me, what I do, my hobbies and a little about the knowledge that I have applied in the creation of this website. Also, one of the things that I want to be able to do in this project is to use this website to include my other projects in which I have worked and will work on in the future. Also, I think it would be a very useful way for recruiters to see my jobs beyond just the resume. One of the things that I want this website to solve are the questions about what I do in my free time, what I am passionate about, what my goals are, and what my projects have been done in class and in my spare time. One of the objectives that I seek to be able to develop and convey to those who visit my website is to find a future fit for a job position, a person who could be asked for help to develop a project that involves the development of web pages. and an opportunity to get feedback and advice from people who have more knowledge about what things can be done better, so that I can also improve as a professional. Also, something that I am looking for through this project is to be able to develop a place in which people feel confident, want to work with me, or want me to be the one to participate in the construction and completion of a project that some individual or company has.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I also want that through that interaction that I develop with people who visit my page, they can in the future help me to have other people interested in my work. I think that the fact of being able to carry out projects will help people to have confidence in my work and that confidence will make them visit my page and not that of others. One of the things that I also want to be able to achieve with my page is connections for the things that I do, such as the hobbies that I practice, which show that it is also important to have time to do activities that we like. I think sharing those things can make and develop even more connection to those who visit my website. I think this can help also in bringing people to my website and no others because we can not only work in some specific project, we can have various terms of conversation on topics such as in my case, soccer, video games, programming and other topics that can come from these topics. I think that when people find something in common with other people, we can also develop trust and have an environment that makes working or collaborating a little more enjoyable. Also, I think that the fact of being able to show my human side shows that we are normal people, who work hard, but who also require free time to carry out other activities that help us and form our identity.

      <h3>Contact me</h3>
      <p>
        I think this website is also an opportunity to learn and run some tests that you would like to do on a website. I think that I can use this website to implement things that I would like to add to my website or for others, since I participated in the construction of this I know a little about its structure and the codes, and style that I have used in it. Which will help me understand at least what I'm doing on this website. On this specific page I would like people to have a kind of small sample of some things that I have done and also the way to contact me
