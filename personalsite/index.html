                <p class="p-1">Hi there! Greetings from my website! I provide you this option so you can learn a little bit more about myself in case we still don't know one other in person. I'm Jose Ayuso, a student studying software engineering who is venturing into the realm of web development. I want to demonstrate to you some of the things I learnt and how I used them to create this website through this website. I want to encourage you to look into it and use this website, if nothing else, to get to know one another. I'm open to criticism and even opportunities to cooperate so that we can both have a significant team influence on your next project.</p>

                <h2>Soccer</h2>
                <p class="p-2">Soccer is something I truly enjoy and it has taught me a lot about working as a team, which is why I included the image about it on my page. No matter how skilled you are at soccer, it won't matter if you don't play or communicate with your teammates. You cannot win a championship with all of your talent and ability. Because of this, one of the things I've learnt at work is that in order to gamble on better outcomes, we will always need assistance, counsel, and teamwork.  I'm willing to accept feedback from you as well as chances to cooperate and work with you on future projects.</p>
