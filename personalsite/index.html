                <p>Hello! Welcome to my website! If we still do not know each other in person, I offer you this alternative so that you can get to know a little more about me. My name is Jose Ayuso, I am a software engineering student who is getting into this world of the web development. Through this website, I want you to show you some things that I learned, and how I applied them in the creation of this website. I want to invite you to explore it and get to know each other at least using this site. I am open to feebback and even opportunities to collaborate and work together in your future project make a meaningful impact as a team in your future project.</p>

                <h2>Soccer</h2>
                <p>The reason why I put the picture about soccer in my website is because it is something that I really enjoy and taught me a lot of things of working as a team. It doesn't matter how good a player you are, in soccer, if you don't play or interact with your team. All your talent and ability that you have will not help you win a championship. That is why one of the things I have learned during this time at work is that we will always need help, advice, and help from a team to bet better results.  I am open to receive some feebback from you and even opportunities to collaborate and work together in your future projects. </p>
