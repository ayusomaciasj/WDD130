            <p> is Software Engineering. In my free time I like to play soccer and</p>
            <p> also watch it on television. I also like to go out and see new places</p>
            <p> as you can see in my photo. I hope to learn a lot in this class and get</p>
            <p> to know my classmates better.</p>
